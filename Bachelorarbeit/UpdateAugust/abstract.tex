\section*{Abstract}

The weighted Linear Ordering Problem \wLOPN is an extension of the well known Linear Ordering Problem \LOPN. For the \LOP we are given $n$ nodes with pairwise weights $w_{i,j}$. Arranging the nodes in a straight line without gaps, the pairwise weights $w_{i,j}$ are added to the objective function, if node $i$ is before node $j$ in the permutation.\\

For the \wLOP however, we also take into account the distances between nodes in the objective function. Despite its recent first introduction, many aspects of this problem are already researched. There exist well performing Integer Linear Programs as well as heuristics which even solve large instances optimally. \\

In this thesis however, the aim is to study the polyhedral structure of the \wLOP, which has not been done before. In particular, we are interested in the dimension of the weighted Linear Ordering polytope.
